# Patient Registration and X-ray Diagnosis React App
Welcome to our React application for registering patients with X-ray images and utilizing advanced AI technology for automatic fracture diagnosis. This app streamlines the process of patient intake by allowing you to register new patients and upload their X-ray images with ease. Once the X-rays are uploaded, the app employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to analyze the images and provide automated diagnoses for different types of fractures.

This AI-powered analysis helps healthcare professionals save time and improve accuracy in diagnosing injuries. The app features a user-friendly interface, allowing seamless navigation and easy access to patient records and diagnosis results.
